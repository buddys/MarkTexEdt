This folder contains a build of the Awesomium.Core.dll assembly, that has been linked
to the packed native libraries available under %SdkFolder%\build\bin\packed\.

If you want to use the packed (compressed) native libraries with your projects,
you will have to use this version of Awesomium.Core instead of the one under Assemblies.
